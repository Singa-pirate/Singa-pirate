Hi, I'm Jiale (@Singa-pirate)

I'm into problem solving and various related fields. In high school, I explored my interest in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science through Olympiads and other competitions. 

Fascinated by technologies enabled by coding and Mathematical knowledge, I choose to study Computer Science with Mathematics second major in NUS. I wish to apply what I've learnt to solve real-world problems and empower communities.

In my free time, I like singing, playing and designing games. I'm a member of NUSChoir and NUS Game Development Group.
